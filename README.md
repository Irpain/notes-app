React Notes Application - AWS Amplify Deployment

Introduction

This project is a React-based Notes Application deployed using AWS Amplify, which provides a seamless development and deployment workflow. The application leverages a Git-based CI/CD pipeline, serverless backend resources, user authentication, and secure storage to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.

This README provides an overview of the project setup, deployment process, and key features.

Features

✅ Frontend
	•	Built with React, enabling a modular and scalable UI.
	•	Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing notes.
	•	Responsive design to ensure accessibility on multiple devices.
	•	User-friendly interface with form-based note creation.

✅ Backend
	•	Uses AWS Amplify to manage backend services.
	•	Serverless architecture ensures high scalability and low maintenance.
	•	Authentication with AWS Cognito, supporting email-based sign-in/sign-up and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
	•	Secure storage for user-generated content such as note-related images.

✅ Authentication
	•	Powered by Amplify Authenticator, handling sign-up, sign-in, password recovery, and MFA.
	•	Users can securely access only their own notes through owner-based authorization.

✅ Storage
	•	Uses Amplify Storage to manage uploaded images securely.
	•	Implements per-user access control, ensuring that each user can only access their own uploaded content.

✅ CI/CD Workflow
	•	GitHub integration for continuous integration and deployment.
	•	Automatic build & deployment triggered on every commit to the main branch.
	•	Deployment to a globally distributed AWS Amplify CDN for high availability and low latency.
