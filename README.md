# 📒 React Notes Application - AWS Amplify Deployment

## 📝 Introduction
This project is a **React-based Notes Application** deployed using **AWS Amplify**, providing a seamless development and deployment workflow. It features:

- **Git-based CI/CD pipeline**
- **Serverless backend resources**
- **User authentication**
- **Secure storage**
- **Global CDN hosting**

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🎨 **Frontend**
✅ Built with **React**, enabling a modular and scalable UI  
✅ Supports **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for managing notes  
✅ Responsive design for accessibility across multiple devices  
✅ User-friendly interface with form-based note creation  

### 🏗 **Backend**
✅ Uses **AWS Amplify** for backend services  
✅ **Serverless architecture** ensures high scalability and low maintenance  
✅ Authentication with **AWS Cognito**, supporting **email-based sign-in/sign-up** and **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**  
✅ Secure **storage for user-generated content** such as note-related images  

### 🔑 **Authentication**
🔐 Powered by **Amplify Authenticator**, handling sign-up, sign-in, password recovery, and MFA  
🔐 Users can securely access only their own notes through **owner-based authorization**  

### 📦 **Storage**
🗂 Uses **Amplify Storage** to manage uploaded images securely  
🗂 Implements **per-user access control**, ensuring that each user can only access their own uploaded content  

### 🔄 **CI/CD Workflow**
⚡ **GitHub integration** for continuous integration and deployment  
⚡ **Automatic build & deployment** triggered on every commit to the main branch  
⚡ Deployment to a globally distributed **AWS Amplify CDN** for high availability and low latency
